# crosswalk

These are the source code and data used for the CrossWalk paper.


Datasets are located in the 'data' directory.

Figures of the 'Experiments' section can be regenerated by running the jupyter notebooks in the 'notebooks' directory. Figure 2 has been generated by the code in the 'tsne' directory.

The 'deepwalk' directory can be used to generate embeddings. Proper dataset files should be copied into the correct sub-directories before running the code.

Directories 'influene_maximization', 'classifier' and 'link_prediction' contain codes for corresponding tasks. Proper dataset files and embeddings (generated by deepwalk) should be copied into the correct sub-directories before running the codes.
