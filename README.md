# Reproducibility Study of “CrossWalk: Fairness-enhanced Node Representation Learning”

## Running our experiments
We are working with python 3.6, and gensim 3.8.3. 

To run all the experiments reproduced in our paper, head to the CrossWalk directory and run ```run_experiments.sh```. 
The code is meant to be run on UNIX-based systems.

The results files along with the corresponding plots can be found in the respective directories of each experiement.
